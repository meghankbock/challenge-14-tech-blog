# challenge-14-tech-blog

## Summary
This repository contains the Javascript, HTML, and CSS code for the Tech Blog Application. This application utilizes Node.js, Express.js, Handlebars.js, Sequelize, and MySQL to create a front- and back-end application that allows users to sign-up/login to the application, create/edit/delete posts, add comments, and access their posts via a user dashboard. The models utilized for this application include Users, Posts, and Comments. These models are connected to the app's front-end via Sequelize and Express.js. On the front-end, Handlbars.js is used to render information and allow the user to interact with the application.
